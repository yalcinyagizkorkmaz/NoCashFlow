## About the Project
DenizŞikayet automates customer complaint management processes, offering faster and more accurate solutions for both customers and bank employees. [cite_start]Thanks to its AI model, complaints are accurately classified and forwarded to the relevant departments[cite: 37, 38], which shortens resolution times and increases operational efficiency.

## Why DenizŞikayet?
[cite_start]In existing banking systems, issues such as difficulty reaching customer representatives [cite: 54][cite_start], long waiting times [cite: 55][cite_start], and misdirection of complaints to incorrect departments [cite: 61, 62] are frequently encountered. DenizŞikayet addresses these problems by providing:
* [cite_start]Accurate and rapid classification of customer complaints[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]Elimination of time loss in forwarding complaints to the correct department[cite: 62].
* [cite_start]Significantly shortened resolution times[cite: 62].
* Increased customer satisfaction.
* Improved bank operational efficiency.

## How it Works?

### For Customers
1.  [cite_start]Users enter their information into the system[cite: 42].
2.  [cite_start]They are prompted to write their complaint in the chat screen that opens[cite: 42].
3.  [cite_start]The complaint is processed by artificial intelligence and its category is determined[cite: 43].
4.  [cite_start]The complaint, along with its determined category, is saved to the database[cite: 44].
5.  [cite_start]The user receives a notification that their complaint has been forwarded[cite: 45].

### For Bank Personnel
1.  [cite_start]Bank personnel log into the system with their Denizbank employee information[cite: 48].
2.  [cite_start]A screen listing the complaints opens[cite: 49].
3.  [cite_start]They can filter complaints by their categories[cite: 50].
4.  [cite_start]They can click on any complaint to view its details and customer information[cite: 51].
5.  [cite_start]They can also change the resolution status of any complaint[cite: 51].
